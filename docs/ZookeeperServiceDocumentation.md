The `ZookeeperService` class in the provided context serves as an abstraction layer over the Apache ZooKeeper operations required for the application. Its primary purposes include:

1. **Node Management**: It handles the creation and management of nodes within the ZooKeeper cluster. This includes creating a persistent parent node and ephemeral child nodes. The persistent parent node acts as a stable reference point for the cluster, while the ephemeral child nodes are used for leader election.

2. **Leader Election**: The class facilitates the leader election process among the nodes in the cluster. By creating ephemeral sequential nodes under the parent node, it allows the system to determine which node has the lowest sequence number, thereby electing that node as the leader. This process ensures that only the leader node performs certain actions, like printing a startup message, to avoid duplication across the cluster.

3. **Cluster Coordination**: Through its operations, the `ZookeeperService` class helps in coordinating actions across the cluster, ensuring that certain tasks are performed only once or are synchronized among the nodes.

4. **Connection Handling**: It manages the connection to the ZooKeeper cluster, including establishing the connection, handling reconnections, and closing the connection gracefully when necessary.

In summary, the `ZookeeperService` class abstracts the complexity of interacting with ZooKeeper for node management, leader election, and cluster coordination, providing a simpler interface for the application to use these functionalities.
